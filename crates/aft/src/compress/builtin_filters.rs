//! Built-in TOML compression filters compiled into the aft binary.
//!
//! Each filter file under `compress/builtin_filters/*.toml` is registered
//! here with its filename stem as the registry key. The filename also
//! serves as the default `[filter].matches` entry when omitted.
//!
//! Filters added later (worker D) just append entries to [`ALL`].

/// Every builtin TOML filter, as `(name, source)` pairs.
///
/// `name` is the filename stem (`make.toml` → `"make"`) and is what user
/// overrides target — `~/.config/aft/filters/make.toml` replaces the builtin
/// of the same name wholesale.
