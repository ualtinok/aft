# M001: Foundation

**Vision:** Give AI coding agents a Rust-powered file toolkit that replaces the read-grep-edit-read cycle with semantic operations — edit by symbol name, read file structure, checkpoint/restore — all through an OpenCode plugin backed by a persistent binary process using tree-sitter for 6 languages.

## Success Criteria

- Agent can edit a function by name through OpenCode and get syntax validation feedback without knowing line numbers
- Agent can read a file's structure (outline) in one call instead of reading the entire file
- Agent can zoom to a single symbol and see what calls it and what it calls
- Agent can checkpoint workspace state, make experimental changes, and restore to the checkpoint
- Agent can undo an individual file edit in one call
- All content flows through JSON stdin/stdout — zero shell escaping errors
- Binary installs via `npm install @aft/core` on macOS (ARM/Intel), Linux (ARM/x64), and Windows (x64)

## Key Risks / Unknowns

- **Tree-sitter symbol extraction accuracy** — query patterns must correctly identify functions, classes, methods, structs across 6 languages with different scope rules. TS/JS/TSX share patterns, but Python (indent scope), Rust (impl blocks), and Go (receiver methods) each need distinct handling.
- **Persistent process reliability** — the binary must stay alive, handle rapid sequential commands, recover from malformed input, and not leak memory over long sessions.
- **Cross-compilation with embedded grammars** — tree-sitter grammar C code must compile and link correctly on all 5 target platforms.

## Proof Strategy

- Tree-sitter accuracy → retire in S02 by proving symbol extraction works correctly on real-world files across all 6 languages with a test suite of representative code patterns
- Persistent process reliability → retire in S01 by proving the binary handles 1000+ sequential commands, malformed JSON recovery, and graceful shutdown
- Cross-compilation → retire in S07 by proving CI builds and tests pass on all 5 platforms

## Verification Classes

- Contract verification: Rust unit tests per command, integration tests for command sequences, tree-sitter query accuracy tests per language
- Integration verification: OpenCode plugin spawns binary, registers tools, agent completes a full edit workflow through tool calls
- Operational verification: binary stays alive across commands, restarts after crash, checkpoint store persists to disk
- UAT / human verification: agent in a real OpenCode session uses AFT tools for a real editing task

## Milestone Definition of Done

This milestone is complete only when all are true:

- All 7 slices are complete and verified
- An agent in OpenCode can outline → zoom → edit_symbol → verify syntax in a single conversation
- Checkpoint/restore round-trips correctly (checkpoint, edit, restore, verify)
- Binary stays alive across 100+ sequential tool calls without memory leak or crash
- `npm install @aft/core` installs the correct platform binary on at least macOS ARM
- All M001 commands handle error cases gracefully (file not found, ambiguous symbol, malformed JSON)

## Requirement Coverage

- Covers: R001, R002, R003, R004, R005, R006, R007, R008, R009, R010, R011, R012, R031, R032, R034
- Partially covers: none
- Leaves for later: R013–R030, R033
- Orphan risks: none

## Slices

- [x] **S01: Binary Scaffold & Persistent Protocol** `risk:high` `depends:[]`
  > After this: binary starts as a persistent process, accepts JSON commands on stdin (ping, version, echo), responds on stdout, stays alive between commands. Verified by integration test sending 100+ commands sequentially.

- [x] **S02: Tree-sitter Multi-Language Engine** `risk:high` `depends:[S01]`
  > After this: binary parses files in all 6 languages and extracts symbols (functions, classes, methods, structs, interfaces, enums) with names, ranges, signatures, scope chains, and export status. Verified by test suite against representative code files per language.

- [x] **S03: Structural Reading** `risk:medium` `depends:[S02]`
  > After this: `outline` returns a file's full symbol structure and `zoom` returns a single symbol's body with caller/callee annotations. Verified by running outline and zoom on real multi-symbol files.

- [ ] **S04: Safety & Recovery System** `risk:medium` `depends:[S01]`
  > After this: `checkpoint` creates named workspace snapshots, `restore_checkpoint` rolls back, `undo` reverts a single file's last edit, `edit_history` shows the per-file edit stack. Verified by checkpoint → modify files → restore → diff shows no changes.

- [ ] **S05: Three-Layer Editing Engine** `risk:medium` `depends:[S02,S04]`
  > After this: `edit_symbol`, `edit_match`, `write`, and `batch` all work with auto-backup, syntax validation, and symbol disambiguation. Verified by editing real code files using all three edit modes and confirming syntax validation catches intentional errors.

- [ ] **S06: OpenCode Plugin Bridge** `risk:medium` `depends:[S01,S02,S03,S04,S05]`
  > After this: all M001 commands are available as OpenCode tools — plugin spawns the binary, manages its lifecycle, and registers tools with Zod schemas. Verified by an agent using AFT tools in a real OpenCode session.

- [ ] **S07: Binary Distribution Pipeline** `risk:low` `depends:[S06]`
  > After this: `npm install @aft/core` installs the correct platform binary on macOS ARM/Intel, Linux ARM/x64, and Windows x64. `cargo install aft` works as fallback. Verified by CI builds passing on all 5 platforms and npm install test on at least 2 platforms.
