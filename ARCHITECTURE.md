# Architecture

## Pattern Overview

**Overall:** TypeScript plugin + Rust worker process over a session-scoped NDJSON bridge

**Key Characteristics:**
- Use `packages/opencode-plugin/src/index.ts` to register OpenCode tools and map them onto Rust commands.
- Use `packages/opencode-plugin/src/bridge.ts` and `packages/opencode-plugin/src/pool.ts` to isolate one `aft` process per session.
- Use `crates/aft/src/commands/` handlers to keep protocol dispatch thin and command logic modular.
- Use `crates/aft/src/edit.rs`, `crates/aft/src/format.rs`, `crates/aft/src/callgraph.rs`, and `crates/aft/src/lsp/` as shared engines behind multiple commands.

## Layers

**OpenCode integration layer:**

## Data Flow

**Tool invocation flow:**

1. Register tool definitions and config-driven surface selection — `packages/opencode-plugin/src/index.ts`
2. Get a session bridge and send a command over NDJSON — `packages/opencode-plugin/src/pool.ts`, `packages/opencode-plugin/src/bridge.ts`
3. Dispatch the request to a Rust handler and return structured JSON — `crates/aft/src/main.rs`, `crates/aft/src/commands/mod.rs`

**Edit pipeline:**

1. Validate permissions and map tool arguments to protocol params — `packages/opencode-plugin/src/tools/hoisted.ts`, `packages/opencode-plugin/src/tools/permissions.ts`
2. Snapshot, mutate, diff, and validate content — `crates/aft/src/edit.rs`
3. Auto-format and optionally collect diagnostics after write — `crates/aft/src/format.rs`, `crates/aft/src/context.rs`

**Call-graph and navigation flow:**

1. Configure project root and initialize file watching — `crates/aft/src/commands/configure.rs`
2. Build or query lazy file-level graph data — `crates/aft/src/callgraph.rs`
3. Serve navigation commands such as callers, impact, and trace-data — `crates/aft/src/commands/callers.rs`, `crates/aft/src/commands/impact.rs`, `crates/aft/src/commands/trace_data.rs`

**Binary resolution flow:**

1. Check cache, npm platform package, PATH, and cargo install locations — `packages/opencode-plugin/src/resolver.ts`
2. Download and checksum-verify a release asset when local resolution fails — `packages/opencode-plugin/src/downloader.ts`
3. Start bridges against the resolved binary and hot-swap after version mismatch — `packages/opencode-plugin/src/bridge.ts`, `packages/opencode-plugin/src/pool.ts`

## Key Abstractions

**BinaryBridge:**
- Purpose: Keep one live `aft` subprocess available for request/response traffic.
- Location: `packages/opencode-plugin/src/bridge.ts`
- Pattern: Persistent child-process adapter with timeout-triggered restart

**BridgePool:**
- Purpose: Scope bridges per OpenCode session and preserve isolated undo history.
- Location: `packages/opencode-plugin/src/pool.ts`
- Pattern: Session-keyed object pool with LRU eviction

**Tool groups:**
- Purpose: Group related OpenCode tool definitions by capability surface.
- Location: `packages/opencode-plugin/src/tools/hoisted.ts`, `packages/opencode-plugin/src/tools/reading.ts`, `packages/opencode-plugin/src/tools/imports.ts`, `packages/opencode-plugin/src/tools/structure.ts`, `packages/opencode-plugin/src/tools/navigation.ts`, `packages/opencode-plugin/src/tools/refactoring.ts`, `packages/opencode-plugin/src/tools/safety.ts`, `packages/opencode-plugin/src/tools/conflicts.ts`, `packages/opencode-plugin/src/tools/lsp.ts`, `packages/opencode-plugin/src/tools/ast.ts`
- Pattern: Thin TypeScript adapters over shared bridge transport

**AppContext:**
- Purpose: Centralize runtime state for commands inside the Rust worker.
- Location: `crates/aft/src/context.rs`
- Pattern: Interior-mutable service container for a single-threaded request loop

**CallGraph:**
- Purpose: Cache per-file call data and answer callers, call-tree, impact, and trace queries.
- Location: `crates/aft/src/callgraph.rs`
- Pattern: Lazy workspace index with invalidation on watcher events

## Entry Points

**OpenCode plugin entry point:**
- Location: `packages/opencode-plugin/src/index.ts`
- Triggers: OpenCode loads the `@cortexkit/aft-opencode` plugin
- Responsibilities: Load config, resolve the binary, create the bridge pool, and register tool definitions

**Rust protocol entry point:**
- Location: `crates/aft/src/main.rs`
- Triggers: `packages/opencode-plugin/src/bridge.ts` spawns the `aft` binary
- Responsibilities: Read NDJSON requests from stdin, dispatch handlers, drain watcher and LSP events, and write JSON responses

**Release automation entry point:**
- Location: `.github/workflows/release.yml`
- Triggers: Git tag pushes matching `v*`
- Responsibilities: Test the workspace, build platform binaries, publish crates and npm packages, and create a GitHub release

## Error Handling

**Strategy:** Return structured Rust `Response::error` payloads from command handlers, convert failed responses into plugin-side exceptions, and restart hung or crashed worker processes in `packages/opencode-plugin/src/bridge.ts`.

## Honest Reporting Convention

**Goal:** an agent reading any AFT response must be able to distinguish three states without ambiguity: (1) the work could not be performed, (2) the work was performed and the result is complete, (3) the work was performed but the result is partial.

**Rule (tri-state):**

1. **`success: false` + `code` + `message`** — the requested work could not be performed. Codes are machine-actionable strings such as `"path_not_found"`, `"no_lsp_server"`, `"project_too_large"`, `"invalid_request"`, `"ambiguous_match"`. The agent must read the message before continuing.

2. **`success: true` + completion signaling** — the work was performed. Tools that produce results MUST report whether the result is complete and, if not, name the gaps. Conventional fields:
    - `complete: true` — the agent can trust absence of items in the result
    - `complete: false` + a named gap field — partial result. Gap fields include `pending_files`, `unchecked_files`, `scope_warnings`, `skipped_files: [{file, reason}]`, `walk_truncated`
    - `removed: bool` (mutations) — did the file actually change? `false` is a valid success when the requested change was a no-op.
    - `no_files_matched_scope: bool` (search tools) — distinguishes "the path/glob you gave me resolved to zero files" from "I searched N files and found nothing"

3. **Side-effect skip codes** — when the main work succeeded but a non-essential side step was skipped (e.g. post-write formatting), use a `<step>_skipped_reason` field so the agent gets specific feedback without treating the whole call as a failure. Approved values:
    - `format_skipped_reason`: `"unsupported_language"` | `"no_formatter_configured"` | `"formatter_not_installed"` | `"timeout"` | `"error"`
    - `validate_skipped_reason`: `"unsupported_language"` | `"no_checker_configured"` | `"checker_not_installed"` | `"timeout"` | `"error"`

**Anti-patterns this convention exists to prevent:**

- Returning `success: true` with empty results when the scope (path/glob) didn't resolve to any files — the agent reads it as "all clear" but really nothing was checked. Return `no_files_matched_scope: true` (when the scope was syntactically valid but matched zero files) or `success: false, code: "path_not_found"` (when a passed path doesn't exist).
- Reusing one skip-reason string for two distinct causes (e.g., `"not_found"` for both "language has no formatter configured" and "configured formatter binary missing"). The agent has different remediations for each — split them.
- Silently dropping files that fail to parse / open / decode inside a multi-file or directory operation. Always include a `skipped_files: [{file, reason}]` array so the agent knows X out of Y files were actually processed.
- Asserting `success: true` after a partial transaction without a `complete: false` flag and a list of pending work.

**Where this is documented in code:** `crates/aft/src/protocol.rs` `Response` doc comment carries the canonical rule and the approved field set. New tools must follow this convention; existing tools are migrating.

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Logging:** Write plugin logs through `packages/opencode-plugin/src/logger.ts` and Rust logs through `env_logger` in `crates/aft/src/main.rs`.

**Caching:** Cache resolved binaries in `~/.cache/aft/bin` through `packages/opencode-plugin/src/downloader.ts`, cache session bridges in `packages/opencode-plugin/src/pool.ts`, cache tool availability in `crates/aft/src/format.rs`, and cache call-graph state in `crates/aft/src/callgraph.rs`.

**Storage:** Store undo snapshots in `crates/aft/src/backup.rs`, named checkpoints in `crates/aft/src/checkpoint.rs`, pending UI metadata in `packages/opencode-plugin/src/metadata-store.ts`, and downloaded binaries in the cache directory managed by `packages/opencode-plugin/src/downloader.ts`.
